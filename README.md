# Use of standard definitions for extent of antibiotic resistance in bacteria: a systematic review and recommendations
 
 **Project description**\n
 The extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is categorised by various terms. It is therefore important to standardise the classification of drug resistant bacteria to ensure clarity and generalisability of evidence across different disciplines and to inform policy. With the development of new therapeutic agents and epidemiological trends, terms previously defined by Magiorakos *et al* in 2011 need to be reviewed and  regularly updated. In addition, new revelations on genomic basis of resistance have been described owing to the advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing. In this study, we present how the definition and classification of drug resistant bacteria are reported in teh recent literature with reference to published standards and offer recommendations for an updated standardisation for drug resistant bacteria.

**Using the data**\n
Raw data from the data extraction can be found under the 'data' folder (MDR_XDR_PDR_Data Extraction.csv). The 'gramposlist.csv' contains a list of Gram-positive bacteria which is used to categorise some of the organisms for analysis. Codes used for the data analysis and creation of figures can be found in the 'codes' folder.
